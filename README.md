# A reactive android weather App

> This article is about a transformation: finding a way of writing a reactive android API with RxJava/RxAndroid from its imperative version. It could be easily applied to any project that work with multiple flux of data. Letâ€™s take a simple app, the weather app (sources available on github).
Android app used for the article : https://www.ekito.fr/people/making-android-api-reactive/

The android project contains 2 modules :
- app (the weather app itself)
- weathersdk (the refactored sdk)


The following versions are available in branches:
- first_version: old/imperative way
- reactive_version: RxJava inside
- master/kotlin_version: RxJava and App written in kotlin
